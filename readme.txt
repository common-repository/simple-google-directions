Simple Google Directions uses the Maps API and returns step-by-step directions.

== Description ==

Allows you to add a simple direction form that you can control the stlying on. It stripes out some google formating and leavings you with plain text and table output. I've used it in a couple of clients of mine and thought it would be cool to be a plugin.

Let me know thoughts and suggestions.
